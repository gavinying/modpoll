WoT TM/TD configuration
=======================

The 2.x development branch accepts JSON configurations using WoT TM/TD 1.1.
Use the same ``--config`` argument for either format. A top-level ``@type``
containing ``tm:ThingModel`` (a string or an array entry) selects TM validation;
otherwise the document is validated as TD. File extensions and URL suffixes do
not select the format. An invalid document fails its selected validation; the
loader does not retry it as the other format. This preview supports the fixed
``tm:ThingModel`` spelling, without resolving alternate JSON-LD aliases.

It rejects CSV input. The canonical ``examples/modsim.tm.json`` uses profile
0.2 standard property Forms and explicit acquisition blocks. The generated
``examples/modsim.generated.td.json`` binds that same 37-property model to local
TCP at port 5020. The interpreter retains profile 0.1 compatibility for existing
configurations; profile details are in ``packages/modpoll-wot/profile.md``.

Each file describes one device. Its ``title`` is the output device name;
``--unit-id`` overrides the instance Unit ID (range 1–254). Without it, each file
uses its optional root ``modv:unitID`` default, falling back to 1. Different files
can therefore address different Unit IDs in one process.
Multiple files may be supplied to ``--config``; titles must be unique.
The existing transport CLI arguments explicitly select the connection endpoint.
A concrete TD's form Unit IDs, addresses and quantities must agree with the model.

The interpreter validates the official, locally bundled TD/TM 1.1 schema,
the project extension schema and cross-field acquisition semantics. It does not
fetch context files or schemas. The local/URL input limit is 1 MiB and the JSON
nesting limit is 64. Duplicate JSON keys and non-finite numbers are rejected.

Profile 0.2 places standard types, access flags and units on properties, and
standard Modbus Forms carry each property's raw mapping. ``modpoll:acquisition``
preserves declared block boundaries, order and holes. Profile 0.1 configurations
remain readable; new examples and converted configurations should use 0.2.
These acquisition semantics are a project extension, not a W3C standard. The
selected subset does not execute arbitrary TD protocol bindings.

Migration from CSV
------------------

* Copy the device name to ``title`` and pass its Unit ID through ``--unit-id``.
* Preserve every poll's table, literal start address, quantity and byte/word order.
* Map each property to a Modbus Form with its raw table, literal address,
  quantity, type and byte/word order. List properties in the matching acquisition
  group to preserve the original block boundaries and polling order. Profile 0.1
  compatibility models retain their documented member-offset rules.
* Express read-only and write-only references through ``readOnly`` and
  ``writeOnly``. Neither flag means read/write. DI and IR are read-only tables;
  their historical ``rw`` sample flags must become ``readOnly: true``.
* Copy units unchanged and express the old scale as ``modpoll:multiplier``.
  Multipliers retain the existing floating-point execution behavior; they are
  not interpreted as divisors. Zero and negative multipliers are valid.
* Preserve effective reference names: the old loader replaced spaces with
  underscores. Unknown types or ambiguous fields require review.

The executable contract and test vectors live under
``packages/modpoll-wot``. Strings, bit selectors, four tables and all four
byte/word orders are represented by the contract. Model inheritance, optional members, URI templates, non-Modbus forms,
and security schemes other than ``nosec`` are rejected in this preview subset.
The interpreter records access flags; raw MQTT write commands retain the existing
1.x behavior and are not property-based writes.

Standard schema validity alone does not establish device correctness or prove
that a general WoT consumer will implement the project's acquisition/transform
extensions. This change adds no HTTP/cache service. See :doc:`v1-compatibility` for intentional
fixes and :doc:`csv-migration` for the reusable AI conversion prompt.

Standard Form profile 0.2
-------------------------

The shared package ``0.2.0a1`` introduces profile ``0.2`` with standard Form
mappings and explicit blocks. The application uses the exact published package
version. See
``packages/modpoll-wot/profile.md`` for API details, parameter precedence,
necessary extensions and external Consumer limits. The source example is
``examples/modsim.tm.json``. Generated TDs are instance artifacts.
