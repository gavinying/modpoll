Migrating CSV configurations
============================

v1 remains available for existing CSV users. v2 accepts TM/TD JSON and provides
an offline validator; it does not load CSV or invoke an AI service at runtime.
Convert new configurations to profile 0.2 as described in
``packages/modpoll-wot/profile.md``; profile 0.1 remains supported for existing
files. Check the executable profile and bundled schemas before using a conversion.

Migration procedure
-------------------

1. Preserve the original CSV and known raw/output samples. Split multiple device
   sections into separate JSON files; give each one its effective device name as
   ``title`` and its default Unit ID as root ``modv:unitID``.
2. Copy every declared block, including holes. JSON addresses are literal PDU
   integers: convert a hexadecimal literal to its numeric value; never subtract
   30001/40001 or guess a zero/one-based correction.
3. Translate references into standard property schemas and Modbus Forms. Preserve
   the effective v1 output key (ASCII spaces became underscores), case and
   punctuation. List each property in the matching ``modpoll:acquisition`` block
   to preserve request boundaries and poll order.
4. Copy type, unit and scale. ``modpoll:multiplier`` multiplies the decoded value;
   it is not a divisor. Zero and negative values are valid. A numeric multiplier
   uses the existing float behavior even if its literal is stored as a decimal
   string. String/bit-group scales that v1 ignored require an explicit review note.
5. Express access with ``readOnly`` / ``writeOnly``; neither means read/write.
   DI/IR must be readOnly even when an old sample says rw. Preserve raw command
   expectations: these flags do not authorize or block MQTT address writes.
6. Validate every output file offline, then compare known vectors and requests.
   Review the report before using the file on a device. A successful schema check
   alone cannot certify a vendor register map.

Commands from the development checkout::

    mise exec -- poetry run python -m modpoll_wot meter.tm.json
    mise exec -- poetry run modpoll --once --config meter.tm.json --tcp HOST --tcp-port PORT --export data.json
    mise exec -- poetry run modpoll --config first.tm.json second.tm.json --tcp HOST

The last command uses each file's Unit ID unless ``--unit-id`` is explicitly given.
Each file creates its own client connection; connection pooling is not added.
A concrete TD's Form Unit IDs must agree with the selected instance. Prefer an
unbound TM when connection information is not supplied; do not invent reachable
HTTP or Modbus endpoints merely to produce a TD.

Reusable AI prompt
------------------

Provide the source CSV, current profile.md and extension schema alongside this
prompt. The AI may prepare files, but an operator still verifies the result::

    Convert the supplied v1 modpoll CSV into the current executable WoT TM 1.1
    profile 0.2. Read the supplied profile.md and acquisition schema first. This
    task changes configuration format; do not redesign addresses or sampling.

    Output:
    - One strict JSON *.tm.json file per device, with unique effective titles,
      root modv:unitID, tm:ThingModel type and the exact supported contexts.
    - A separate migration report listing every original device, block and ref,
      its new field/property, any corrected access flag, and unresolved issues.
    - Equivalent modpoll CLI commands and the exact validation commands/results.
      If you cannot run them, explicitly say "not executed".

    Preserve every poll block's order, table, literal start, quantity and holes.
    Map coil/discrete_input/input_register/holding_register to the documented
    modv:entity terms. Put raw type and literal address/quantity on each Modbus
    Form, and list the original polling groups under modpoll:acquisition.
    BE_BE/BE_LE/LE_BE/LE_LE map respectively to byte/word flags true/true,
    true/false, false/true, false/false.

    Preserve each effective ref key: v1 replaced ASCII spaces with underscores;
    do not change case, punctuation or hyphens. Preserve every block's order,
    start and quantity without converting to per-property polling.
    Bit-table offsets count eight-bit groups; register offsets count registers
    only when the selected profile uses member offsets.
    address:bit is allowed only for a register bool bit 0..15. Strings count bytes.
    Numeric/string bit-table members must fit complete requested payload bytes;
    do not rely on padded response bits. Preserve the documented legacy bit-table
    numeric packing rather than inventing a new byte/word transformation.

    Normalize table/type/access tokens to lowercase, as v1 did; a blank access
    field defaults to r. Preserve type widths and unit labels. Copy scale as modpoll:multiplier, including
    zero, negative and fractional literals. Do not replace multiplication by a
    guessed vendor gain/divisor. Use number schemas for float/scaled numeric
    output, integer for unscaled integers, string for stringN, boolean for a
    selected register bit, and boolean arrays for bool groups.

    Translate r/w/rw to the standard property access flags. DI/IR are read-only:
    report old rw flags and the correction. Do not claim these flags add raw
    MQTT write authorization or inverse engineering-value encoding.

    Do not guess unknown types, invalid rw tokens, incomplete rows or duplicate
    effective names. Do not silently omit anything to make validation pass.
    If a decision is needed, mark the separate report as blocked/needs-review
    and explain it; keep reports and unsupported fields out of executable JSON.
    A TD is optional only when explicit instance endpoint parameters are supplied;
    Forms must agree with the group/member mapping and selected Unit ID.

    Check every source ref is accounted for. Run the offline validator, compare
    group requests, and compare provided raw/engineering-value vectors. Passing
    structural validation is not evidence of real-device correctness.

Review checklist
----------------

* Every device/ref is accounted for; duplicate names and aliases are reviewed.
* Table, literal address, count and byte/word flags match the source blocks.
* Offsets and full type spans fit each block; no accidental per-property polling.
* Units, multiplier direction, zero scales and large-integer expectations match.
* Access corrections and rejected source mistakes are explicit in the report.
* All JSON files pass the offline profile validator; independent vectors and
  output comparisons pass. Unknown vendor facts remain unresolved, not guessed.
* No runtime CSV fallback, AI calls or device-library dependency is introduced.

The authored ``examples/modsim.tm.json`` / ``modsim.generated.td.json`` pair and the
independent vectors in the tests demonstrate the process. Migrating the entire
``contrib`` tree is not a release condition.
