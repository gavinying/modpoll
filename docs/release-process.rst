Preview release process
=======================

The application and ``modpoll-wot`` interpreter are independently versioned in
this repository. The interpreter validates bundled WoT TD/TM 1.1 schemas and
Modpoll profiles 0.1/0.2; it is not a device execution service.

1. On ``v2``, select a candidate whose exact commit passes quality, Python
   3.10/3.11/3.12, documentation and simulator interoperability CI.
2. Set the interpreter version and metadata, build wheel/sdist and verify bundled
   schemas offline in an independent environment. Push the unique tag
   ``modpoll-wot-v0.2.0a1``. ``preview-core.yml`` requires the accepted SHA,
   publishes both artifacts, verifies a registry installation and records a
   separate prerelease without changing the stable latest release.
3. After registry installation succeeds, pin the application to that exact
   version. Refresh lock/requirements. Build wheel/sdist and Docker; the wheel
   guard rejects source URLs and non-exact interpreter requirements.
4. Verify the application candidate and push ``v2.0.0a2`` at that accepted SHA.
   ``preview-app.yml`` publishes the application, an explicit amd64/arm64 image,
   versioned documentation and runs registry-installed acceptance with no
   application source directory. Previews never move stable Docker aliases.
5. Check PyPI, GitHub Release assets, both image manifests and Pages URLs.
   Record commit/tag, workflow links, checksums and acceptance results.

Tag pushes route releases using the workflow stored at that tag; every checkout
explicitly selects the tag. The v1 release-please flow remains on ``main``.
Shared-package tags cannot enter the application preview flow, and stable tags
are rejected by the preview guard. Never replace an existing tag or PyPI version.
Retries compare artifact filenames and SHA-256 against PyPI; different bytes
require the original artifacts or a new version, not an overwrite. Retain workflow
artifacts if a later publishing stage fails and rerun only failed jobs.

After publication, registry acceptance waits up to ten minutes in total for
the version metadata and wheel to become visible, retrying HTTP 404 and missing
wheel metadata with fresh cache-busting URLs. Other HTTP errors and SHA-256
mismatches fail immediately. A timeout remains a failure; retain the original
build artifacts for recovery rather than replacing the tag or release.

Pages uses serialized complete snapshots. ``1.x/`` and ``v2/`` coexist, root
continues serving stable documentation, and ``vocab/`` is preserved independently.
The initial 1.x tree is built from the pinned v1.6.1 release. Subsequent stable
releases update their line while preserving other directories; PRs only build.
No preview is considered fully accepted until the published-package acceptance
job succeeds. See :doc:`validation` for the published preview acceptance and
maintainer-confirmed Eastron physical RS485 result.
