Modpoll 2.0.0a2 is a functional preview using WoT TM/TD 1.1 profile 0.2 as its canonical configuration model. Existing polling blocks, CLI/JSON/MQTT output and raw address commands are retained. No platform service or device library is required.

Install explicitly: `uv tool install --prerelease allow "modpoll[serial]==2.0.0a2"`. The application pins `modpoll-wot==0.2.0a2`. Docker: `topmaker/modpoll:2.0.0a2` (amd64/arm64); stable `latest` remains unchanged. Existing CSV users can keep `modpoll<2`.

Documentation: [1.x](https://top-maker.github.io/modpoll/1.x/), [2.x preview](https://top-maker.github.io/modpoll/v2/), [CSV migration and AI prompt](https://top-maker.github.io/modpoll/v2/csv-migration.html), [compatibility matrix](https://top-maker.github.io/modpoll/v2/v1-compatibility.html). Profile 0.2 is a project extension over the W3C draft Modbus vocabulary, not a new W3C standard. Profile 0.1 remains readable for existing configurations.

Acceptance includes 37 known simulator properties, exact block requests, independent byte/word vectors, UDP, POSIX virtual RTU/ASCII, MQTT 3.1.1/5.0, QoS0/1/2, TLS, command readback and failure recovery. Release acceptance additionally installs the published package in an environment without application sources.

Intentional fixes include all same-address aliases, short-response validity, failed one-shot exit status and bounded MQTT shutdown. CSV has no runtime fallback; migrate and validate files explicitly. The shared interpreter currently executes no Modbus requests and supports only the documented Modbus subset; no inheritance/actions/general JSON-LD runtime or property-based inverse writes are added.

Tested software matrix: Linux/Python 3.10–3.12. Automated serial tests use virtual terminals; the maintainer additionally confirmed Eastron physical RS485 polling on 2026-10-28. Windows/macOS serial hardware and other setups require their own validation. TLS retains an existing deprecated TLS-version selector. MQTT QoS does not make device writes idempotent; property access flags do not authorize raw MQTT address writes. Check the release workflow result and attached acceptance reports before deployment.
