# Executable configuration contract 0.1 (development)

This is Modpoll's supported WoT TM/TD 1.1 subset for replacing CSV configuration.
It is not a general WoT runtime. The Modbus binding document remains a draft:
https://w3c.github.io/wot-binding-templates/bindings/protocols/modbus/.
Its entity, address, quantity and byte/word-order vocabulary is reused. Ordered
acquisition groups, offsets, precise decoding and multipliers are project extensions.
They do not claim standard W3C acquisition or transformation semantics.

Use `python -m modpoll_wot_modbus MODEL [--unit-id N]` to validate and inspect a
model without opening a device connection. Schemas are bundled locally; the
loader does not dereference contexts or remote schema dependencies. The official
TD/TM schemas identify themselves as `1.1-12-March-2025` (Draft 7).

| 1.x input | Contract 0.1 |
| --- | --- |
| device name | `title`, used verbatim as output device name |
| Unit ID | Explicit instance argument; default 1, range 1–254 |
| poll table | group `modv:entity`: Coil, DiscreteInput, InputRegister, HoldingRegister |
| poll start/count | group `modv:address` / `modv:quantity`, literal PDU addresses |
| poll endian | `modv:mostSignificantByte` and `modv:mostSignificantWord` booleans |
| ref effective name | property key and member `modpoll:property` |
| ref address | member `modpoll:offset`, relative to group start |
| ref `address:bit` | member `modpoll:bit`, 0–15, register bool only |
| ref dtype | member `modpoll:dataType` |
| ref rw | standard property `readOnly` / `writeOnly`; neither means rw |
| ref unit | standard property `unit` |
| ref scale | member `modpoll:multiplier`, multiplication, never inferred division |

The JSON root declares `modpoll:version: "0.1"` and `modpoll:acquisition`.
Context aliases must match the supported project and draft Modbus namespaces;
these are not arbitrary remotely resolved JSON-LD aliases. The project namespace
is reserved for this development contract; its hosted documentation is not yet
published. Concrete TD Forms use `modbus+tcp` URLs. The Form's entity, operations,
unit/address/quantity and declared payload/byte order must match the group/member.
Explicit transport CLI options select the actual endpoint, allowing the same
configuration to be tested through a proxy or alternate transport. Concrete TD
Unit IDs must match `--unit-id`; unbound TMs can be instantiated with any supported ID.

Register member offsets count 16-bit registers. Bit-table member offsets count
eight-bit groups relative to poll start, preserving the old behavior; poll counts
still specify physical bits. A final partial bit group is clipped by the executor.
Bit tables support bool/bool8/bool16; numeric bit-table decoding is explicitly
unsupported in this subset. Register types are int/uint16/32/64, float16/32/64,
bool/bool8/bool16 and stringN. String lengths count bytes, including odd lengths;
spans must fit the declared block. A register bool with a bit selector is a scalar
boolean; bool groups are arrays with boolean items. Strings cannot be multiplied.
Float and fractional-multiplier outputs require a number property schema.

Groups preserve order, boundaries and holes. Reads are limited to 125 registers
or 2000 physical bits per request, within 0–65535. No coalescing takes place.
Each property must have exactly one mapping. Duplicate backing address/bit pairs
within a group are rejected to avoid silent omission by the existing executor.
Overlapping views at distinct starting offsets remain explicit, independent values.
Missing fields, unknown executable extension fields, invalid access, non-finite
values/multipliers, duplicate JSON keys and invalid type combinations fail the
whole file with source and field diagnostics. Inputs are bounded to 1 MiB and 64
nested containers. Invalid files do not yield partially configured devices.

DI/IR are read-only. The historical simulator CSV's rw flags for those tables are
corrected to readOnly in the fixtures; no unsupported write capability is promised.
The interpreter records access flags; raw MQTT write commands retain the 1.x raw
address behavior. This milestone does not add property-based writes or inverse
engineering-value transforms. Multipliers are retained as Decimal in the model
but adapted to the existing float execution semantics. Int64 without a multiplier
stays a Python integer. JSON/JavaScript consumers must still account for their own
numeric precision limits.

Inheritance, links, optional TM members, URI templates, root operation Forms,
actions/events, unsupported Form terms and non-nosec security schemes are rejected.
Model/TD schema validation does not prove that a stock WoT consumer will implement
this acquisition extension or its transforms. In particular, a direct Modbus Form
identifies raw device access; engineering-value interpretation requires the project
transform metadata. No HTTP endpoint or cache service is declared.

`examples/modsim.tm.json` is an authored mapping of `examples/modsim.csv`, retaining
four groups and 37 properties; it is not generated from CSV at runtime.
`examples/modsim.td.json` binds the same mapping to the documented local TCP
endpoint. Their mappings are checked against the CSV in tests. Runtime equivalence
checks additionally compare independently known initial values, complete JSON
snapshots, rendered tables, and the exact four requests against modsim. Shared
remote modsim state may have been written by others, so remote checks compare
successive read-only snapshots rather than assuming fixed initial values.

The shared package currently uses a local Poetry path dependency for development.
Before publishing the application, publish the shared package and replace that
path with its exact registry version. A development application wheel containing
a local dependency URL is not a portable public release artifact.
