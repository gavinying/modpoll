## Get Started!

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `modpoll` for local development.

Here we assume you already have `python`, `poetry`, and `Git` installed. Otherwise, you can use the [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf) tool to manage the required tools or install them manually according to the `.tool-versions` file.

1. Fork the `modpoll` repo on GitHub, and then clone your fork locally,

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/modpoll.git
    cd modpoll
    ```

2. Install and activate the dev environment,

    ```bash
    make install
    ```

3. Create a branch for local development,

    ```bash
    git checkout -b your-branch-name
    ```

    Now you can make your changes locally.

4. Don't forget to add test cases for your added functionality in the `tests` directory.

5. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass the formatting tests,

    ```bash
    make check
    ```

    Then, validate that all unit tests are passing:

    ```bash
    make test
    ```

6. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub:

    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    git push origin your-branch-name
    ```

    Please note this project follows [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification for git commits. Some of our CI/CD pipelines rely on such convention, for example, your commit message starting with `feat:` might bump the `MINOR` version.

7. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

Happy Coding!
